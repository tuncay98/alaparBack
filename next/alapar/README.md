(80%) Ongoing Project...

# Using 
1. Next.js framework 
2. Tailwind.css 
3. Redux (Activated but the usage code in pages is removed)
4. Ant Design 
5. Typescript 
6. Vanilla Javascript 
7. Saas (Will be removed in the near future) 
8. Framer Motion

# Logic

1. Pages detectes which actions must be done by looking a path of the page.
2. Page gets and sets all necessary React Nodes and states from a file.
3. The File has access to those files written with Typescript, and The reason of using Typescript is Type Annotation, by this way we know exactly what we need while writing JS
4. All Object.tsx and State.tsx files are an interface for JSON coming from APIs and let us make pure exact state objects. 
5. Static Generator lets us cache JSONs coming from APIs in CDN


# ToDo and keep in mind:
1. Module .d.ts is used for some places, and it will be used much more as needed in the future 
2. Websocket will be used in near future.
3. Server Side rendering pages will be added
